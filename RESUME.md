# Know Yourself — Resume State

Last updated: 2026-10-10

## Purpose
This file is the canonical continuity checkpoint for the Know Yourself (KY) project. When the user says **“Resume KY”** or **“save mcp”**, recover this file first, inspect the live GitHub state, and continue from the latest verified checkpoint. Do not rely on conversation summaries alone when repository verification is available.

## Confirmed architecture: 3framework
1. **Canonical Chart + Immutable Evidence** — deterministic chart mechanics and source evidence are the authoritative foundation. Do not invent chart facts or silently substitute unsupported interpretations.
2. **Adaptive User Context** — retain relevant personal context, prior questions, preferences, and saved insight history separately from canonical chart mechanics and source evidence.
3. **ChatGPT live reasoning layer** — reason directly on top of the first two layers, adapting explanations to the user's question and context. Do not turn this into an unnecessary five-layer architecture.

Keep mechanics, source teaching, and reflective synthesis distinguishable. If evidence is missing or conflicting, state that clearly rather than guessing.

## Product decisions to preserve
- Product: Know Yourself, an AI-powered Human Design companion.
- My Chart is the primary personal chart experience; Chart Library is secondary.
- Main experience: Foundation, Characteristics, Current Experience, Journey, and Connection.
- Natal definition must remain separate from temporary transit activations.
- Confirmed natal chart used for the user's Golden Chart #2: 15 April 1982, Baarn, Netherlands, 07:38.
- Confirmed natal channels: 3–60, 11–56, 28–38, 32–54, 34–57, and 42–53.
- Do not infer authority or chart facts without validating the deterministic chart output. Previous chart-reading mistakes make explicit verification important.
- Swiss Ephemeris remains an allowed calculation option; do not remove it without approval.
- PHS and RP are in scope. Gene Keys are deferred.
- Keep the experience warm, personal, clear, and inviting rather than mechanical.
- Avoid asking the user to manually code when a safe tool-driven path is available.
- Do not create a Lovable project or spend Lovable credits without explicit approval.
- Do not use Vercel as a development/deployment dependency unless the user explicitly reopens that decision. Do not add new Vercel work by default.
- Never commit API keys, credentials, or secrets.

## Repository
- Repository: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp
- Main branch: `main`
- README currently describes the website artifact as V22. Confirm the actual branch/deployment version before relying on version labels.
- Existing branches observed on 2026-10-10:
  - `main`
  - `fix/my-chart-inline-handler`
  - `feature/live-api-v1`

## Current verified checkpoint (2026-10-10)
- The repository and README were accessible through GitHub MCP.
- `RESUME.md` did not exist when checked; this file is being added to close that continuity gap.
- Main branch `index.html` was inspected. It contains inline navigation handlers such as `onclick="go('chart')"`.
- Open PR #2: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp/pull/2
  - Title: “Fix My Chart inline JavaScript syntax”
  - Its description says the fix escapes the `chart` argument in inline `onclick` attributes.
  - Do not assume it is merged or that the deployed app works until the PR state, CI, preview, and navigation are verified.
- Open draft PR #1: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp/pull/1
  - Gate 57.4 evidence retrieval safeguards and regression tests.
  - Keep as draft; do not merge until focused tests pass and changes are reviewed.
- The user reported that the app opened but My Chart/navigation did not behave as expected. This remains the immediate validation priority.
- CI status and production deployment health have not yet been independently verified in this checkpoint.
- Earlier discussions described Steps 1 and 2 as completed and Step 3 as Canonical Data Contracts; validate repository evidence before declaring any step complete. Continue the agreed workflow rather than restarting it.

## Next actions
1. Read this file and inspect current GitHub state before acting.
2. Check PR #2 state, diff, CI checks, and preview. Verify the fix on the preview before any merge.
3. Confirm My Chart navigation and chart rendering; then check birth-data form and Explore/Ask navigation.
4. Inspect PR #1's focused Gate 57.4 regression tests separately. Keep it draft until tests pass and review is complete.
5. Resume the 3framework work from the last verified repository state. Do not reintroduce a five-layer architecture.
6. Update this file whenever a major milestone, architecture decision, verified test result, or blocker changes. Include commit/PR references and clearly distinguish verified facts from assumptions.

## Continuity protocol
When asked to “Resume KY”:
- Read `RESUME.md` first.
- Verify current branch heads, open PRs, latest commits, and relevant CI before deciding the next step.
- Compare live repository state with this checkpoint; live verified repository state wins if this file is stale.
- Report only the current blocker and next action; avoid making the user repeat established decisions.
- Proceed autonomously on reversible, low-risk work. Pause for major architectural, commercial, licensing, data-loss, or irreversible decisions.
- Never claim that a change was committed, pushed, merged, deployed, or tested unless the tool result verifies it.
