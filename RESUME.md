# Know Yourself — Resume State

Last updated: 2026-10-10

## Purpose
This file is the canonical continuity checkpoint for the Know Yourself (KY) project. When the user says **“Resume KY”** or **“save mcp”**, recover this file first, inspect the live GitHub state, and continue from the latest verified checkpoint. Do not rely on conversation summaries alone when repository verification is available.

## Confirmed architecture: 3framework
1. **Canonical Chart + Immutable Evidence** — deterministic chart mechanics and source evidence are the authoritative foundation. Do not invent chart facts or silently substitute unsupported interpretations.
2. **Adaptive User Context** — retain relevant personal context, prior questions, preferences, and saved insight history separately from canonical chart mechanics and source evidence.
3. **ChatGPT live reasoning layer** — reason directly on top of the first two layers, adapting explanations to the user's question and context. Do not turn this into an unnecessary five-layer architecture.

Keep mechanics, source teaching, and reflective synthesis distinguishable. If evidence is missing or conflicting, state that clearly rather than guessing.

## Product decisions to preserve
- Product: Know Yourself, an AI-powered Human Design companion.
- My Chart is the primary personal chart experience; Chart Library is secondary.
- Main experience: Foundation, Characteristics, Current Experience, Journey, and Connection.
- Natal definition must remain separate from temporary transit activations.
- Confirmed natal chart used for the user's Golden Chart #2: 15 April 1982, Baarn, Netherlands, 07:38.
- Confirmed natal channels: 3–60, 11–56, 28–38, 32–54, 34–57, and 42–53.
- Do not infer authority or chart facts without validating the deterministic chart output. Previous chart-reading mistakes make explicit verification important.
- Swiss Ephemeris remains an allowed calculation option; do not remove it without approval.
- PHS and RP are in scope. Gene Keys are deferred.
- Keep the experience warm, personal, clear, and inviting rather than mechanical.
- Avoid asking the user to manually code when a safe tool-driven path is available.
- Do not create a Lovable project or spend Lovable credits without explicit approval.
- Do not use Vercel as a development/deployment dependency unless the user explicitly reopens that decision. Do not add new Vercel work by default.
- Never commit API keys, credentials, or secrets.

## Repository
- Repository: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp
- Main branch: `main`
- README currently describes the website artifact as V22. Confirm the actual branch/deployment version before relying on version labels.
- Existing branches observed on 2026-10-10:
  - `main`
  - `fix/my-chart-inline-handler`
  - `feature/live-api-v1`

## Current verified checkpoint (2026-10-10)
- The repository and README were accessible through GitHub MCP.
- `RESUME.md` did not exist when checked; this file is being added to close that continuity gap.
- Main branch `index.html` was inspected. It contains inline navigation handlers such as `onclick="go('chart')"`.
- Open PR #2: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp/pull/2
  - Title: “Fix My Chart inline JavaScript syntax”
  - Its description says the fix escapes the `chart` argument in inline `onclick` attributes.
  - Do not assume it is merged or that the deployed app works until the PR state, CI, preview, and navigation are verified.
- Open draft PR #1: https://github.com/mobinhan/know-yourself-mvp/pull/1
  - Gate 57.4 evidence retrieval safeguards and regression tests.
  - Keep as draft; do not merge until focused tests pass and changes are reviewed.
- The user reported that the app opened but My Chart/navigation did not behave as expected. This remains the immediate validation priority.
- CI status and production deployment health have not yet been independently verified in this checkpoint.
- Earlier discussions described Steps 1 and 2 as completed and Step 3 as Canonical Data Contracts; validate repository evidence before declaring any step complete. Continue the agreed workflow rather than restarting it.

## Next actions
1. Read this file and inspect current GitHub state before acting.
2. Check PR #2 state, diff, CI checks, and preview. Verify the fix on the preview before any merge.
3. Confirm My Chart navigation and chart rendering; then check birth-data form and Explore/Ask navigation.
4. Inspect PR #1's focused Gate 57.4 regression tests separately. Keep it draft until tests pass and review is complete.
5. Resume the 3framework work from the last verified repository state. Do not reintroduce a five-layer architecture.
6. Update this file whenever a major milestone, architecture decision, verified test result, or blocker changes. Include commit/PR references and clearly distinguish verified facts from assumptions.

## Continuity protocol
When asked to “Resume KY”:
- Read `RESUME.md` first.
- Verify current branch heads, open PRs, latest commits, and relevant CI before deciding the next step.
- Compare live repository state with this checkpoint; live verified repository state wins if this file is stale.
- Report only the current blocker and next action; avoid making the user repeat established decisions.
- Proceed autonomously on reversible, low-risk work. Pause for major architectural, commercial, licensing, data-loss, or irreversible decisions.
- Never claim that a change was committed, pushed, merged, deployed, or tested unless the tool result verifies it.

## Correction, repetition, and autosave protocol
Treat a user correction, a confirmed assistant mistake, or a repeated failure/repetition as a signal to update the working method—not merely to apologize and continue.

When the user points out that an answer or action is wrong:
1. Stop repeating the disputed claim or action.
2. Acknowledge the specific error plainly; do not defend an unverified assumption.
3. Re-check the relevant source of truth (live repository, code, test result, chart-engine output, or cited evidence).
4. Correct the result and, where feasible, add a focused regression check or change the procedure that allowed the mistake.
5. If the correction changes durable project facts, an agreed decision, a workflow rule, a known failure mode, or a future recovery step, update this checkpoint and commit/push the update to GitHub, then fetch it back to verify the remote state.
6. Report exactly what was corrected, what was saved, and what remains unverified.

When the same issue, question, or work is repeated:
- First check whether it was already completed, decided, or attempted; do not restart from scratch without a reason.
- Record the cause and prevention rule when a repeated failure reveals a process gap.
- Autosave meaningful lessons and state changes; do not create noisy commits for inconsequential wording or transient discussion.

Autosave trigger examples:
- The user says the assistant is wrong or identifies a factual/technical mistake.
- The assistant discovers its own earlier claim was wrong.
- A workflow, build, test, navigation, or recovery attempt fails repeatedly.
- The user has to repeat a decision, preference, instruction, or correction because it was not retained.
- A project decision, completed milestone, blocker, or next action materially changes.

Important limitation: this file records the required protocol; it does not itself execute tools automatically. In each session, follow the protocol when GitHub tools are available, and never claim a remote save until the commit and fetched remote content confirm it.

## Safeguard implementation in progress (2026-10-10)
- Added `docs/SAFEGUARD_PROTOCOL.md`: engineering recovery/correction rules plus KY 3framework product safeguards.
- Added `engine/correction-governance.js`: pure policy validation for correction records. It does not persist data, learn silently, mutate canonical chart mechanics, or modify shared knowledge.
- Added `engine/test_correction-governance.mjs`: regression coverage for reported-by-default status, consent, evidence/reviewer requirements, canonical mechanics test references, and supersession.
- Added the focused correction-governance test to `.github/workflows/step1-engine.yml`.
- Work is isolated on branch `feature/correction-safeguards`; it is not merged. CI and review must pass before merging.
- This is the first product-side safeguard implementation, not complete end-to-end functionality: correction storage, user-facing feedback capture, access control, and database persistence are not implemented by this policy module and must be designed against the existing backend contracts before any writes.
- Do not treat a reported correction as truth. Keep user-specific feedback separate from shared knowledge and chart mechanics. The policy always returns `canonical_source_mutation_allowed: false`; a separate reviewed change and regression run is required.
